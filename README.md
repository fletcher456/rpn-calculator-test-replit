# HP 29C RPN Calculator

A not-yet-faithful web-based recreation of the HP 29C RPN calculator with scientific functions and stack operations. I'm using this project to learn more about vibe coding.



## About the HP-29C

The HP-29C is a programmable scientific calculator. the product line that contains the 29C may well have been introduced by Hewlett-Packard in 1977, but I don't know. It uses Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) for calculations, which is cool and lends itself well to writing short programs.

## Features

- Authentic RPN (Reverse Polish Notation) operation
- Four-level stack (X, Y, Z, T registers)
- Scientific functions (trigonometric, logarithmic, exponential)
- Memory operations
- Shift keys for alternate functions
- Realistic styling matching the original HP 29C 😜

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or newer)
- npm (included with Node.js)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hp-29c-calculator.git
   cd hp-29c-calculator
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:5000
   ```

## Using the Calculator

### RPN Basics

The HP 29C uses Reverse Polish Notation (RPN), which works differently from algebraic calculators:

1. Enter the first number
2. Press ENTER
3. Enter the second number
4. Press the operation key

For example, to calculate 5 + 3:
- Press `5`
- Press `ENTER`
- Press `3`
- Press `+`

### Stack Operations

The calculator maintains a 4-level stack (X, Y, Z, T):
- X: Currently displayed value
- Y: Value automatically pushed when you press ENTER or an operation
- Z: Third value in the stack
- T: Fourth value in the stack

Stack manipulation keys:
- `x⇄y`: Swaps the X and Y registers
- `R↓`: Rolls the stack down (T→Z→Y→X→T)
- `R↑`: Rolls the stack up (T←Z←Y←X←T)

### Scientific Functions

The calculator includes various scientific functions:
- Trigonometric functions: `sin`, `cos`, `tan` and their inverses
- Logarithmic functions: `ln`, `log`
- Exponential functions: `e^x`, `10^x`, `y^x`
- Other functions: `√x`, `x²`, `1/x`, `%`

### Shift Keys

Two shift keys provide access to alternate functions:
- `f`: Orange/gold functions (primary alternate functions)
- `g`: Blue functions (secondary alternate functions)

## Customizing the Calculator

To modify the calculator keys or functionality:

1. Edit `client/src/lib/keyMatrix.ts` to change key labels, colors, or actions
2. Modify `client/src/lib/calculator.ts` to alter calculator behavior
3. Update CSS variables in `client/src/index.css` to change the visual style
