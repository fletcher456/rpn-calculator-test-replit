# HP 29C RPN Calculator

A not-yet-faithful web-based recreation of the HP 29C RPN calculator with scientific functions and stack operations. I'm using this project to learn more about vibe coding.

The keyboard layout is now accurate from a labeling perspective (though not yet from a semantic or display perspective). The labels on keys closely match the original HP 29C, though colors need to be adjusted, key actions need to be elaborated and properly implemented, and label appearances may need refinement. Switches are not yet fully correct, but the actual label strings are now quite close to the original!



## About the HP-29C

The HP-29C is a programmable scientific calculator. the product line that contains the 29C may well have been introduced by Hewlett-Packard in 1977, but I don't know. It uses Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) for calculations, which is cool and lends itself well to writing short programs.

## Features

- Authentic RPN (Reverse Polish Notation) operation
- Four-level stack (X, Y, Z, T registers)
- Scientific functions (trigonometric, logarithmic, exponential)
- Memory operations
- Shift keys for alternate functions
- Realistic styling matching the original HP 29C 😜

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or newer)
- npm (included with Node.js)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hp-29c-calculator.git
   cd hp-29c-calculator
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:5000
   ```

## Using the Calculator

### RPN Basics

The HP 29C uses Reverse Polish Notation (RPN), which works differently from algebraic calculators:

1. Enter the first number
2. Press ENTER
3. Enter the second number
4. Press the operation key

For example, to calculate 5 + 3:
- Press `5`
- Press `ENTER`
- Press `3`
- Press `+`

### Stack Operations

The calculator maintains a 4-level stack (X, Y, Z, T):
- X: Currently displayed value
- Y: Value automatically pushed when you press ENTER or an operation
- Z: Third value in the stack
- T: Fourth value in the stack

Stack manipulation keys:
- `x⇄y`: Swaps the X and Y registers
- `R↓`: Rolls the stack down (T→Z→Y→X→T)
- `R↑`: Rolls the stack up (T←Z←Y←X←T)

### Scientific Functions

The calculator includes various scientific functions:
- Trigonometric functions: `sin`, `cos`, `tan` and their inverses
- Logarithmic functions: `ln`, `log`
- Exponential functions: `e^x`, `10^x`, `y^x`
- Other functions: `√x`, `x²`, `1/x`, `%`

### Shift Keys

Two shift keys provide access to alternate functions:
- `f`: Orange/gold functions (primary alternate functions)
- `g`: Blue functions (secondary alternate functions)
